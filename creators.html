                	<p>Olly Skillman-Wilson, a game artist working on The Signal From Tšlva, uses a Wacom Intuos 4 every day for work and general computing, and says "there is certainly some appeal in the thought of being able to do 3D high polygon sculpting on a huge retina display." However, he can't justify the cost for "the specs of a desktop from two years ago," as "it's just not something that is going to be replacing the complex chain of tools that make up my very specific workflow. A 3D version of paint is not going to, and probably not trying to, replace that."</p>

                	<p> Hayden Scott-Baron, a game designer and freelance illustrator, recently started using his Surface Pro 4 connected to an external monitor at his desk instead of an iMac. "The Surface Pen is pretty fantastic, but definitely not as comfortable as the Wacom pens for longer sessions," Scott-Baron explained.
The Surface Pen has higher input lag than Wacom's high-end solutions is "not actually a deal breaker" for Scott-Baron, but "the lack of responsiveness with light pressure is a problem." Other designers agreed. "The pressure sensitivity could be a little better," said Love. "It's hard to get a perfect taper on our lines while we're drawing sometimes." Indeed, sensitivity and handling are big complaints with the Pen.

                	<p>Scott Coello, a freelancer animator and director, uses Wacom tablets like the Intuos and Cintiq as his main setup, and a Surface Pro 4 "for the road." Comfort Love and Adam Withers, co-creators of Rainbow in the Dark, The Uniques and The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing Comics, use Wacom and Yiynova tablets with displays for the bulk of their work, and a Surface Pro 4 when not at their desks. "It's like our digital sketchbook," said Withers. Love continued: "We use it for presentations, working on scripts and lettering our comics on the road."
