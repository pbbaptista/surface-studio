            Ever since the beginning of Microsoft that we have done our best to deliver top-end technology that is one step ahead of what users need. It is our belief that technology is a powerful tool that can be used by individuals or teams to improve lives and change the world.</p></br>
<p>
With Microsoft Surface Studio, we focused on bringing a powerful tool for creators, one that would feel seamless to their workflow.</p></br>
            
<p>
    We studied and analyzed how designers, artists, photographers and videographers worked and based on those results, we thought about how we could improve their work tools and thus came up with Microsoft Surface Studio.</p></br>
<p>
Surface Studio is not only powerful, with its i5/i7 Intel processor, it is also practical. We realized a lot of creators have a overcrowded work place, and that is one of the things we realized we could change. By being able to easily switch between desktop mode to drawing table mode, now you only need one tool for all your creative needs.</p></br>
<p>
Pair your Surface Studio with our complementary tools, such as the Surface Dial, the Surface Pen or even the ergonomic keyboard and not only will your creative work be more seamless, you’ll also maximize your productivity.
